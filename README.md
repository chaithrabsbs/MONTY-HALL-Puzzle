# MONTY-HALL-Puzzle

The Monty Hall is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle,
loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal
and named after its original host, Monty Hall.
The concept of the game is that the player sees three closed doors - behind
One is a car, and behind the other two are goats. The game starts with the
player gets to choose a door, without opening it. Then the presenter
opens one of the two remaining doors (but never the one with the car) and
shows that this door does not contain profit. The player is then given
another choice to change the door.
The question is whether the chances of winning increase if the player
changes the door.


 -  The solution is built with C#.
In this application, we can simulate a given number of games, whether you change the door or not.

In the interface we are able to enter a number of simulations and choose whether or not
to change the door. Then press a button that starts the simulation by calling backend that performs the requested number of simulated games. When backend answers then the results of the simulations are printed. Testing is also included to prove the chances of winning the game.
